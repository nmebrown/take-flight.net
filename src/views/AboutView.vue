    <p>
      Hello! My name is Cole Brown and this is my online portfolio. I'm a front-end developer from
      San Francisco, California, currently based in Vancouver, British Columbia.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have over 15 years of web design experience and am always looking for new opportunities to
      expand my skills. I specialize in creating custom Drupal and Wordpress themes for non-profit
      and community support organizations. I've worked for a variety of companies and design firms
      over the years, including
      <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/" target="_blank">Autodesk</a>, the
      <a href="http://www.ubc.ca" target="_blank">University of British Columbia</a>, and most
      recently,
      <a href="http://www.raisedeyebrow.com" target="_blank">Raised Eyebrow Web Studio</a>, a local
      Vancouver development house.
    </p>

    <p>
      I love building projects from the ground up and take pride in delivering quality, hand-coded,
      W3C compliant websites. I'm fluent in HTML & CSS, specialize in building fully responsive
      websites, and I'm able to integrate a custom theme with a variety of content management
      systems, including Drupal and Wordpress, or custom backends built with PHP or Ruby/Ruby on
      Rails.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm available now! Please download a copy of my resume or
